Hey!
I'm a fullstack developer specializing in web application development. I was part of a Jr. called Knex to which I dedicated myself a lot, acquiring knowledge and experience in several areas such as: people management, digital marketing, project management and planning.
I am passionate about web application development and am currently in the process of specializing in react javascript and nodejs. I am a curious person and tend to ask a lot of questions if I find myself in doubt. Everyday I keep working on my best version.
