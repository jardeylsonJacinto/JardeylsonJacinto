Hello! I'm a Fullstack programmer with experience in web development, with a specialized focus on back-end. My passion is to create innovative and sustainable solutions, combining my expertise in different technologies.

My main skills include:

ReactJS: I am proficient in developing modern and responsive user interfaces using ReactJS. I worked on complex projects, implementing reusable components and integrating APIs.

NodeJS and Express: I specialize in server-side development using NodeJS and the Express framework. I create robust, scalable and efficient APIs for web apps.

NestJS: I have advanced knowledge in NestJS, a progressive NodeJS framework that uses TypeScript. I use this framework to create solid architectures, with separation of responsibilities and high modularity.

TypeScript: I use TypeScript to develop more secure and maintainable applications. Static typing and object-oriented structure provide a solid foundation for developing complex projects.

MongoDB: Work with NoSQL databases like MongoDB to efficiently store and retrieve data. I have experience in data modeling and query optimization.

With a greater emphasis on back-end development, I am constantly looking to improve my skills and learn new technologies to create efficient solutions. I'm a passionate problem solver, always looking for interesting challenges that I should create innovative and effective solutions.

In addition to my technical background, I am a good collaborator and have effective communication skills. I am able to work in a team and I am always willing to contribute with ideas and solutions for the success of the project.

If you are looking for a highly competent Fullstack programmer with a back-end focus and experience in ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, NestJS, TypeScript and MongoDB, I am available to discuss collaboration opportunities. Let's build something amazing together!
